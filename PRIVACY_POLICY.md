OpenAI-powered sub-tasks generator ("we", "us", or "our") respects the privacy of our users ("you" or "your") and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and store your personal information when you use this app.

### Personal Information

The application will not be collecting any personal data related users such as name, address, phone number or email address. All Atlassian account details will be managed by Atlassian and the application has no access to such data.

### Information Collection and Use of Data

When you use our Jira Plugin, we collect certain information to enable us to provide you with the functionality of the Plugin. Specifically, **we collect the Jira Issue description, Project ID, Issue ID, and Parent Issue Key associated with the Jira issues** that you interact with through the Plugin. This information is necessary for the Plugin to work properly and use for performing tasks such as getting relevant issues metadata, and generate subtasks directly from using the Plugin.

The Project ID is a unique identifier assigned to each Jira project, and it allows the Plugin to integrate with the specific project that you are working on. The Issue ID is a unique identifier assigned to each Jira issue, and it allows the Plugin to track and manipulate the specific issue that you are interacting with. The Parent Issue Key is a reference to the parent issue of a sub-task, which allows the Plugin to manage sub-tasks within Jira.

As part of our commitment to improving the functionality of the Jira Plugin, we have integrated OpenAI technology into our development process. This allows us to leverage cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to analyze data related to the use of the Plugin and gain valuable insights into user behavior and preferences. **To enable this process, we transmit certain data related to the use of the Plugin, such as Jira issue descriptions, to OpenAI for processing. The processing of this data by OpenAI is done on our behalf, and is subject to OpenAI's own privacy policies.**
